 ù  Screenshot now saves BMPs instead of RAWs (still saves PCXs in 8 bit mode)
 ù  Fixed lucent blit.  Also implemented color addition/subtraction (only
    fixed level so far)

May 20, 2000
 ù  Started converting the opaque blits to ASM (a little faster, 'sides
    I need the practice ^_^)
 ù  Added support for v2+i VSPs (15bit uncompressed)
 ù  Player now turns whether the tile is obstructed or not.
 ù  Key bindings weren't working for some reason.  (aen in the middle of
    something?)  Fixed it

May 21, 2000
 ù  Fixed a bug in the entity activation code.

June 1, 2000
 ù  PaletteMorph emulation in hicolor mode implemented.  No bugs apparent.

June 4, 2000
 ù  Fixed the "off by one" error with fseekline.  Not really an error, but it
     caused incompatibility with V2.

June 7, 2000
 ù  Added support for Version 5 VSPs (16bit compressed)  15bit adjustment
     routines not tested yet, though.

July 10, 2000
 ù  Version 4 CHRs implemented.  15bit adjustment stuff not tested either. :P

August 3, 2000
 ù  Fixed the "S X" thing in the render string.  Works now.

September 21, 2000
 ù  Got the VCC source from aen! whoohoo!
 ù  Implemented "bitdepth" (returns the colour depth)

September 24, 2000
 ù  Discovered that entities with a speed of 0 don't move.  (did I do that,
    or was it aen?)

September 30, 2000
 ù  Added sqrt, fwritebyte, fwriteword, and fwritequad.
 ù  Fixed a funky little bug that had to do with the keys not being updated
    correctly.
 ù  Fixed some funky things that were happening with entities. (specframe was
    disabled, and so were entity speeds greater than 4)

September 31, 2000
 ù  Implemented table based (variable) lucency.  Mode 2 is variable lucency,
    5 is variable addition, and 6 is variable subtraction.  The "variableness"
    is set by invoking the new function, CalcLucent(level), where level is
    the level of translucency.
